## Headings

### A third-level heading

```markdown
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.

## Quoting text

Text that is not a quote  

```markdown
> Text that is a quote
```

> Text that is a quote  

In other words, adding two spaces at the end of each line in the cited text results in a line break.

```markdown
> Text that is a quote  
> Text that is a quote  
```

> Text that is a quote  
> Text that is a quote


    üåµ Tip: When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing R. You can quote an entire comment by clicking , then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Keyboard shortcuts."

[Keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/keyboard-shortcuts)  

## Quoting code

You can highlight code or a command within a sentence using single backticks, and you can use a keyboard shortcut(Mac `Command+E` or Windows/Linux `Ctrl+E`) to insert backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

For more information, see "[Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)."

If you are frequently editing code snippets and tables, you may benefit from enabling a fixed-width font in all comment fields on GitHub. For more information, see "[About writing and formatting on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github#enabling-fixed-width-fonts-in-the-editor)."


## üìç Supported color models

In issues, pull requests, and discussions, you can call out colors within a sentence by using backticks. A supported color model within backticks will display a visualization of the color.

The background color is `#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode.

| Color | Syntax       | Example              | Output               |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| HEX   | `#RRGGBB`    | `#0969DA`            | `#0969DA`            |
| RGB   | `rgb(R,G,B)` | `rgb(9, 105, 218)`   | `rgb(9, 105, 218)`   |
| HSL   | `hsl(H,S,L)` | `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)` | `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)` |


## Links

To create an inline link in Markdown, you can enclose the link text in brackets and the URL in parentheses, or use keyboard shortcuts for quicker linking and automatically create a link from a selected text by pasting a URL from the clipboard.

    [link text](URL)

To create a Markdown hyperlink, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Command+V` to insert the link, or `Command+Shift+V` to replace the selected text with the link.

    üåµ Tip: GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see "Autolinked references and URLs."

[Autolinked references and URLs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls)

## üìç Section links

You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose <svg version="1.1" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="octicon octicon-link" aria-label="the link" role="img"><path d="m7.775 3.275 1.25-1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1 4.95 4.95l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1-4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1 .018-1.042.751.751 0 0 1 1.042-.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l2.5-2.5a2.002 2.002 0 0 0-2.83-2.83l-1.25 1.25a.751.751 0 0 1-1.042-.018.751.751 0 0 1-.018-1.042Zm-4.69 9.64a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 2.83 0l1.25-1.25a.751.751 0 0 1 1.042.018.751.751 0 0 1 .018 1.042l-1.25 1.25a3.5 3.5 0 1 1-4.95-4.95l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 0 1 4.95 0 .751.751 0 0 1-.018 1.042.751.751 0 0 1-1.042.018 1.998 1.998 0 0 0-2.83 0l-2.5 2.5a1.998 1.998 0 0 0 0 2.83Z"></path></svg>.

## Relative links

In GitHub, you can use relative links and image paths to create navigation between files within your repository, allowing readers to easily access different files.

```markdown
[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/README.md)
```


[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/README.md)


GitHub automatically adjusts relative links and image paths based on the current branch, ensuring they always work, and the links are relative to the current file, while links starting with "/" are relative to the repository root, making relative links more convenient for users who clone the repository and avoiding potential issues with absolute links in clones.


## üî´ Images

[Images](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images)

![Screenshot of a comment on a GitHub issue showing an image, added in the Markdown, of an Octocat smiling and raising a tentacle.](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

GitHub supports embedding images into your issues, pull requests, discussions, comments and .md files. You can display an image from your repository, add a link to an online image, or upload an image. For more information, see "[Uploading assets](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#uploading-assets)."


Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.
